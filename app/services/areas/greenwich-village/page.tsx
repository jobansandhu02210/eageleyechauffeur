const faqs = [
  {
    q: 'Do you provide black car pickups in the NYU campus area and Washington Square Park?',
    a: "Yes. The NYU campus and Washington Square Park area — including LaGuardia Place, Mercer Street, West 4th Street, and the surrounding blocks — are active pickup zones for Eagle Eye. Faculty, administrators, and visiting lecturers regularly book our service for airport connections and corporate travel. We also handle pickups for NYU event guests who need reliable transport without app uncertainty on busy campus weekends.",
  },
  {
    q: 'Is late-night black car service available in Greenwich Village and the West Village?',
    a: "Absolutely. Greenwich Village and the West Village have among the most active late-night dining scenes in Manhattan — Bleecker Street, Christopher Street, Hudson Street, and the surrounding restaurant rows run well past midnight. Pre-booking your pickup ensures your chauffeur is at the agreed corner when you leave, not a surge-priced app circling SoHo. We recommend booking your return at the time you place the outbound reservation.",
  },
  {
    q: 'How do I get a black car from Greenwich Village to JFK or LGA?',
    a: "Book through our website or via WhatsApp with your Village address, airport terminal, and departure time. Your flat rate is confirmed immediately. Typical transit from Greenwich Village to JFK via the Holland Tunnel or the BQE is 40–55 minutes; to LaGuardia plan 30–45 minutes. For early-morning flights, we recommend a pre-dawn pickup to avoid any morning bridge traffic — your chauffeur is confirmed the evening before.",
  },
  {
    q: 'Can you pick up from restaurants and private events in the Village?',
    a: "Yes. Whether you&apos;re wrapping a private dinner on Hudson Street, leaving a book launch in the West Village, or finishing a gallery dinner in SoHo adjacent areas, Eagle Eye provides pre-arranged departure transport. We position your chauffeur at the agreed block at the agreed time — no circling, no wait. Many Village clients use hourly hire so the chauffeur stays on standby throughout a multi-venue evening.",
  },
  {
    q: 'Do you serve the Meatpacking District from Greenwich Village?',
    a: "Yes. The Meatpacking District borders Greenwich Village and West Village to the north and is fully within our service area. We handle pickups and drop-offs throughout the Meatpacking corridor — Gansevoort Street, Little West 12th Street, and the surrounding blocks — for restaurant dinners, nightlife events, and the High Line adjacent areas that straddle the Village-Chelsea border.",
  },
  {
    q: 'Is hourly black car hire available for a night out in the Village?',
    a: "Yes. Hourly hire in Greenwich Village is particularly practical for evenings that move between multiple destinations — a pre-dinner cocktail bar on Christopher Street, dinner on Bleecker, and a nightcap on Hudson, for instance. Book hourly and your chauffeur stays with your party through the full booking window, positioned nearby at each stop so you move seamlessly without waiting or re-booking.",

              <p className="text-sm text-brand-grey leading-relaxed">Greenwich Village&apos;s irregular street grid — a legacy of its pre-grid settlement — means many blocks don&apos;t follow Manhattan&apos;s numbered pattern. Streets like Grove, Commerce, Bedford, and Barrow curve and intersect at odd angles, and several blocks are one-way in non-obvious directions. Your chauffeur will confirm the exact pickup corner via text — often the nearest accessible avenue (Hudson, Seventh Avenue South, or Sixth Avenue) rather than a narrow side street. The West Village section west of Hudson Street is particularly narrow; pickups are usually staged on West Street or Washington Street near the waterfront. For restaurant departure pickups on Bleecker or Christopher, your chauffeur confirms a block in advance and stays in contact so you walk out to a waiting car rather than waiting on a busy sidewalk.</p>
