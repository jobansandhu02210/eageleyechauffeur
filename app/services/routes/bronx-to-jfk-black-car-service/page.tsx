  },
  {
    q: 'How long does it take from the Bronx to JFK?',
    a: 'The Bronx is the farthest NYC borough from JFK, so plan for 40–70 minutes depending on your neighborhood and traffic conditions. Mott Haven in the South Bronx runs 35–50 minutes, Fordham and Tremont 40–55 minutes, and more northern neighborhoods like Riverdale, Co-op City, Pelham Bay, and City Island run 45–70 minutes. We always recommend building in buffer time for early morning flights.',

    q: 'Do you cover all Bronx neighborhoods for JFK transfers?',
    a: 'Yes. Eagle Eye Chauffeur serves every Bronx neighborhood — Riverdale, Fordham, Co-op City, Parkchester, Mott Haven, Pelham Bay, Tremont, City Island, Highbridge, Concourse, Norwood, Woodlawn, Morris Park, Soundview, Hunts Point, and beyond. There are no geographic restrictions or neighborhood surcharges within the Bronx.',
  },
  {
    q: 'Are tolls included in the Bronx to JFK price?',
    a: 'Yes. Our flat rate includes all bridge and tunnel tolls on the Bronx-to-JFK route — whether the driver takes the Triborough (RFK) Bridge, Throgs Neck, Whitestone, or another route. There are no itemized toll add-ons or surcharges. The price confirmed at booking is your complete all-in price.',
  },
  {
    q: 'Can I book a Bronx to JFK pickup for early morning flights?',
    a: 'Yes. Eagle Eye Chauffeur operates 24 hours a day, 7 days a week. Early morning departures — 4am, 5am, 6am — from the Bronx to JFK are fully covered. Given the longer drive time from the Bronx, we work with you to determine the ideal pickup time based on your flight and terminal. Your driver is confirmed the evening before, so there are no last-minute uncertainties.',

            Why Bronx Residents Choose Eagle Eye for JFK
          </h2>
          <p className="text-brand-grey mb-8 max-w-2xl">
            The Bronx is the borough farthest from JFK — which makes reliability, flat pricing,
            and toll transparency more important here than anywhere else. Here is why Eagle Eye
            is the right choice.
          </p>
          <div className="bg-brand-white border border-brand-light p-8">
            <ul className="space-y-5 text-brand-grey">
              <li>
                <strong className="text-brand-black">No bridge or tunnel markup — all tolls included in your flat rate.</strong>{' '}
                The Bronx-to-JFK route involves multiple toll structures depending on the bridge
                used. Eagle Eye quotes you one flat rate that covers the complete journey —
                driver, vehicle, and all tolls — with nothing added at the end.
              </li>
              <li>
                <strong className="text-brand-black">Bronx traffic expertise for every route.</strong>{' '}
                Major Deegan, Cross Bronx, Bruckner, Whitestone Bridge, Triborough — our chauffeurs
                know the Bronx road network and select the optimal route based on real-time
                conditions. You are not relying on an algorithm that picks the same highway at 7am
                as it does at midnight.
              </li>
              <li>
                <strong className="text-brand-black">Flight tracking with automatic adjustment for delays.</strong>{' '}
                For longer routes like Bronx to JFK, even a 30-minute flight delay can turn an
                early pickup into unnecessary waiting. Eagle Eye monitors your flight in real time
                and adjusts your chauffeur&apos;s schedule accordingly — you are never paying for
                a driver who arrived too early because of a delay you had no control over.
              </li>
              <li>
                <strong className="text-brand-black">Door-to-door from any Bronx address.</strong>{' '}
                Whether you are in Riverdale by the Hudson or City Island on the Sound, Mott Haven
                or Co-op City — your chauffeur comes to your front door. No walking to a corner,
                no curbside zone, no car service that only covers parts of the borough.
              </li>
              <li>
                <strong className="text-brand-black">TLC licensed and fully insured on every booking.</strong>{' '}
                Eagle Eye chauffeurs hold New York TLC licenses and carry commercial insurance that
                meets NYC standards for professional transportation. Every ride is backed by the
                licensing and insurance framework that sets professional black car apart from
                peer-to-peer transportation apps.
