    q: 'How much is a Staten Island to Manhattan car service?',
    a: 'All rates are flat and confirmed at booking — no surge pricing, no hidden fees. The Verrazano-Narrows Bridge toll is fully included in your flat rate. There is no additional charge when you cross the bridge. Get an instant quote on our booking page by entering your Staten Island address and your Manhattan destination.',
  },
  {
    q: 'How long does it take from Staten Island to Manhattan by car?',
    a: 'Travel time from Staten Island to Manhattan ranges from 35 to 65 minutes depending on your pickup neighborhood, your Manhattan destination, and traffic. St. George and Stapleton in the north of the island reach Midtown in approximately 35–50 minutes via the Verrazano and Brooklyn-Queens Expressway or Staten Island Expressway. Tottenville in the south adds 15–20 minutes. By comparison, the Staten Island Ferry plus subway takes 30–45 minutes from St. George alone — and only door-to-terminal in Whitehall, not to Midtown or the Financial District.',
  },
  {
    q: 'Is the Verrazano Bridge toll included in the rate?',
    a: 'Yes. The Verrazano-Narrows Bridge toll is included in your confirmed flat rate. Eagle Eye Chauffeur includes all bridge and tunnel tolls in every booking. The price you see when you reserve is the total price you pay — no additions at the toll plaza.',
  },
  {
    q: 'Is black car service better than the Staten Island Ferry for commuters?',
    a: 'It depends on your destination and priorities. The Staten Island Ferry is free but only travels between St. George and Whitehall Terminal in Lower Manhattan. If your destination is Midtown, the Upper East Side, or anywhere that requires a subway transfer, a black car is significantly faster and more direct — door-to-door with no transfers, no waiting on platforms, and no carrying luggage through turnstiles. For a business meeting, a corporate event, or a trip with baggage, black car service is the clear choice.',
  },
  {
    q: 'Can I book a Staten Island to Manhattan car service for a corporate event?',
    a: 'Yes. Eagle Eye Chauffeur is available for corporate events, business meetings, client pickups, and hourly-hire arrangements across Manhattan. For regular corporate commuters or executives who need reliable door-to-door service with professional presentation, we offer standing booking arrangements. Contact us directly by phone, email, or WhatsApp to discuss your corporate needs.',

            Why Choose Black Car Service for Staten Island to Manhattan
          </h2>
          <p className="text-brand-grey mb-10 max-w-2xl">
            For commuters, business travelers, and anyone needing a reliable, direct connection from
            Staten Island to Manhattan, black car service offers advantages the ferry simply cannot match.
          </p>
          <div className="space-y-7">
            <div>
              <h3 className="font-semibold text-brand-black mb-1">Door-to-door — no ferry, no subway</h3>
              <p className="text-brand-grey text-sm leading-relaxed">
                The Staten Island Ferry terminates at Whitehall Terminal in Lower Manhattan. If your
                destination is Midtown, the Upper West Side, or any other neighborhood, you still need
                the subway — with your bags, in a crowd, on a schedule. Eagle Eye takes you directly
                from your front door to your exact Manhattan address. One vehicle. Zero transfers.
              </p>
            </div>
            <div>
              <h3 className="font-semibold text-brand-black mb-1">Verrazano toll included — no surprise charges</h3>
              <p className="text-brand-grey text-sm leading-relaxed">
                The Verrazano-Narrows Bridge carries one of the highest E-ZPass toll rates in the
                New York metro. Eagle Eye includes every toll in your confirmed flat rate at the time of
                booking. No adjustments, no additions, no end-of-ride sticker shock.

            <div>
              <h3 className="font-semibold text-brand-black mb-1">Flat rate — no surge pricing during rush hours</h3>
              <p className="text-brand-grey text-sm leading-relaxed">
                Rush-hour traffic between Staten Island and Manhattan is notorious — the Staten Island
                Expressway and the Gowanus corridor can be severely congested during peak times.
                Your Eagle Eye rate is fixed the moment you book and does not respond to demand signals
                or traffic conditions. Morning commute or Friday afternoon — same price.

                Whether you are heading to a hotel in Midtown with full suitcases or commuting to a
                Manhattan office with a laptop bag and dry cleaning, your chauffeur handles the loading
                and unloading. No heaving bags through ferry terminals or down subway steps.

              <p className="text-brand-grey text-sm leading-relaxed">
                Arriving at a client meeting or a Wall Street appointment in a clean luxury vehicle
                with a professional chauffeur makes a different impression than stepping off a
                crowded ferry. Eagle Eye provides the standard of service that matches the importance
                of your Manhattan engagements.
