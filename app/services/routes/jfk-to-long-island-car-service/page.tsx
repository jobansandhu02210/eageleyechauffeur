            Why Choose Eagle Eye for JFK to Long Island
          </h2>
          <p className="text-brand-grey mb-10 max-w-2xl">
            Long Island is 118 miles long and encompasses two counties, dozens of distinct communities,
            and the Hamptons. Eagle Eye Chauffeur covers it all — from Valley Stream to Montauk.

              <p className="text-brand-grey text-sm leading-relaxed">
                Nassau County and Suffolk County together span the full length of Long Island. Many car services
                cap out at Nassau County destinations. Eagle Eye covers the entire island — from the Nassau
                County communities bordering Queens (Valley Stream, Hempstead, Garden City) all the way east
                to Huntington, Smithtown, and the South Fork. One service, all of Long Island.

              <p className="text-brand-grey text-sm leading-relaxed">
                Summer Friday afternoons and holiday weekends to the Hamptons are peak travel periods.
                Demand-based pricing can make costs
                unpredictable and extreme. Eagle Eye rates are flat year-round — the same rate in August
                as in February. Your JFK to Southampton or Montauk rate is locked at booking, no matter
                the season or the level of traffic on the Expressway.

              <p className="text-brand-grey text-sm leading-relaxed">
                JFK is one of the busiest international airports in the United States, and delays and gate
                changes are common. Eagle Eye monitors your arriving flight in real time. Whether your
                connection lands early or your international flight is delayed by two hours, your chauffeur
                adjusts their timing automatically. You will receive a WhatsApp message with your driver
                details before you land.

                Routes from JFK to Long Island pass through tolled corridors including the Belt Parkway
                and, for some destinations, the Midtown Tunnel or the Queens-Midtown crossings.
                All of these are included in your Eagle Eye flat rate. The number you confirm at booking
                is the number on your receipt — no adjustments after the fact.

                No scrambling for a car at JFK, no waiting with luggage after a long flight.
