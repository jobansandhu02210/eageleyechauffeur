const faqs = [
  {
    q: 'How far is MetLife Stadium from Manhattan, and how long does it take?',
    a: 'MetLife Stadium in East Rutherford, NJ is roughly 10 miles from Midtown Manhattan via the Lincoln Tunnel and NJ Route 3. On a normal day the drive is about 20–30 minutes; on event days — and especially for the World Cup — allow 45–75 minutes and plan to arrive early. Your chauffeur monitors live traffic and plans the departure time and route (Lincoln Tunnel or George Washington Bridge) accordingly.',
  },
  {
    q: 'Do you provide car service to MetLife for the 2026 World Cup?',
    a: 'Yes. MetLife Stadium hosts eight FIFA World Cup 26 matches, culminating in the Final on Sunday, July 19, 2026. We provide flat-rate, door-to-door transfers from any Manhattan hotel or address to the stadium for every match, with a pre-arranged post-match pickup so you are not stranded in the crowd afterward. Book early — demand around the Final and the New York/New Jersey matches will be extreme.',
  },
  {
    q: 'What is the best way to get from Manhattan to MetLife?',
    a: 'Pre-booked private car service is the most reliable option. NJ Transit runs event trains from Secaucus, but they are crowded and slow to clear after big events, and rideshares surge heavily on game and concert nights. A flat-rate chauffeur from Eagle Eye locks your price at booking and gives you door-to-door service from any Manhattan address, with luggage help and a driver who waits for you afterward.',
  },
  {
    q: 'How much does car service from Manhattan to MetLife cost?',
    a: 'Eagle Eye uses flat-rate pricing confirmed at booking with no surge. The fare depends on your exact Manhattan pickup location and vehicle class (sedan, SUV, or Sprinter for groups). Get an instant quote on our booking page — the price you see is locked, even on a World Cup Final night.',
  },
  {
    q: 'Where does the car drop off and pick up at MetLife on event days?',
    a: 'On major event and World Cup days there is a security perimeter around MetLife, and permitted drop-off and pickup points change with the event plan. Your chauffeur uses the closest authorized drop point to the gates and pre-arranges a specific post-event pickup spot, then contacts you by WhatsApp when it is time to walk out — no hunting for a car in a packed lot.',
  },
  {
    q: 'How early should I leave Manhattan for a World Cup match at MetLife?',
    a: 'For a World Cup match, plan to arrive at the stadium 2–3 hours before kickoff — security screening, fan zones, and road management around MetLife take time. From Manhattan that usually means leaving 3–4 hours before kickoff. We will recommend an exact departure window based on your seat location, the match, and live traffic.',
  },
  {
    q: 'Do you pick up from Manhattan hotels?',
    a: 'Yes. We offer concierge-style pickup from any Manhattan hotel or residence — Midtown, Times Square, Upper East Side, Tribeca, the Financial District, or anywhere in the borough. Your driver is at the entrance at your scheduled time and helps with bags and gear.',
  },
  {
    q: 'Can you handle groups going to MetLife together?',
    a: 'Yes. For families, corporate suites, and fan groups we offer First Class SUVs (up to 7) and Sprinter vans for larger parties, so everyone travels together from Manhattan and leaves together after the match — one flat rate, one pickup, one driver.',

            Manhattan to MetLife on Event Day: What to Expect
          </h2>
          <div className="space-y-4 text-brand-grey text-sm leading-relaxed">
            <p>
              The drive from Manhattan to MetLife is short — about 10 miles — but event-day timing is
              everything. From Midtown, the fastest route is usually the Lincoln Tunnel to NJ Route 3 West,
              which leads directly toward the Meadowlands Sports Complex; from Upper Manhattan, the George
              Washington Bridge to I-95 can be quicker. Your chauffeur watches live conditions and picks
              the better of the two on the day.
            </p>
            <p>
              On major event days, and above all for the World Cup, expect a security perimeter, managed
              traffic patterns, and moving road closures around the stadium. Permitted drop-off points shift
              with the event plan, so your driver uses the closest authorized drop to the gates and
              pre-arranges a specific post-event pickup spot — then messages you on WhatsApp when it is time
              to walk out, so you are not searching a packed lot for a car.
            </p>
            <p>
              For a World Cup match, plan to be at the stadium 2–3 hours before kickoff for screening and the
              fan zones, which typically means leaving Manhattan 3–4 hours ahead. Because your fare is a flat
              rate locked at booking, none of that traffic changes your price — and unlike a rideshare, your
              driver is already waiting when the final whistle blows.
