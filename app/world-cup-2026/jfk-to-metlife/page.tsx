const faqs = [
  {
    q: 'How far is MetLife Stadium from JFK, and how long does the drive take?',
    a: 'MetLife Stadium in East Rutherford, NJ is about 28 miles from JFK — typically a 45–60 minute drive, crossing the city to New Jersey. On event days and during the World Cup, allow extra time: plan to leave JFK at least 90 minutes before you need to be at the stadium, more for a World Cup match. Your chauffeur tracks your flight and live traffic and plans the route accordingly.',
  },
  {
    q: 'Do you provide JFK to MetLife transfers for the 2026 World Cup?',
    a: 'Yes. MetLife Stadium hosts eight FIFA World Cup 26 matches, including the Final on Sunday, July 19, 2026, and JFK is the region\'s main international gateway for arriving fans. We meet you at baggage claim, handle your luggage, and take you directly to the stadium or your Manhattan hotel — flat rate, flight tracked, with a pre-arranged post-match pickup. Book early; World Cup demand will be extreme.',
  },
  {
    q: 'Do you offer meet and greet at JFK?',
    a: 'Yes. Your chauffeur meets you inside the terminal at baggage claim with a name sign, assists with luggage, and escorts you to the vehicle. We serve all JFK terminals — T1, T4, T5, T7, and T8 — and track international arrivals so your driver waits through customs delays at no extra charge.',
  },
  {
    q: 'Can I go directly from JFK to MetLife Stadium for an event?',
    a: 'Yes. We handle direct JFK-to-stadium transfers. If your flight lands with enough time before kickoff or showtime, your driver takes you straight to MetLife. We monitor your flight and adjust pickup timing so you make it — and hold your bags in the vehicle during the event if needed.',
  },
  {
    q: 'What about JFK to hotel, then hotel to MetLife on event day?',
    a: 'Yes — multi-leg bookings are available. Many visitors book JFK to a Manhattan hotel on arrival, then a separate Manhattan-to-MetLife transfer on event day. We coordinate both under one account, so your ground transportation for the whole trip is handled.',
  },
  {
    q: 'Where does the car drop off and pick up at MetLife on event days?',
    a: 'On major event and World Cup days there is a security perimeter and managed traffic around MetLife, and permitted drop-off points shift with the event plan. Your chauffeur uses the closest authorized drop to the gates and pre-arranges a specific post-event pickup point, then contacts you on WhatsApp when it is time to walk out.',
  },
  {
    q: 'How much does JFK to MetLife car service cost?',
    a: 'Eagle Eye uses flat-rate pricing confirmed at booking with no surge. The fare depends on your vehicle class (sedan, SUV, or Sprinter for groups) and any added stops. Get an instant quote on our booking page — the price is locked, even on a World Cup Final night.',

            JFK to MetLife on Event Day: What to Expect
          </h2>
          <div className="space-y-4 text-brand-grey text-sm leading-relaxed">
            <p>
              JFK to MetLife is about 28 miles, and the route crosses from Queens into New Jersey — typically
              the Belt Parkway and Verrazzano-Narrows Bridge through Staten Island to the New Jersey Turnpike,
              or the BQE to the George Washington Bridge, before joining NJ Route 3 toward the Meadowlands.
              Your chauffeur picks the faster of the two based on live traffic and the time of day.
            </p>
            <p>
              On major event days, and above all for the World Cup, expect a security perimeter, managed
              traffic, and moving road closures around the stadium. Permitted drop-off points shift with the
              event plan, so your driver uses the closest authorized drop to the gates and pre-arranges a
              specific post-event pickup — then messages you on WhatsApp when it is time to walk out.
            </p>
            <p>
              Coming straight from an international arrival, build in a buffer: customs and baggage at JFK can
              run long, and a World Cup crowd at MetLife means arriving 2–3 hours before kickoff. Because your
              fare is a flat rate locked at booking, none of that traffic or delay changes your price, and
              your driver is already waiting when you land and again when the match ends.
